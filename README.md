# Loan Default Prediction with Machine Learning

> A complete end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting loan defaults, helping financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions and reduce portfolio risk.

## Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive ML pipeline that predicts loan default probability using customer demographics, loan characteristics, and historical repayment data. The solution achieved **68% ROC-AUC** and includes production-ready deployment options.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Feature Engineering** - Loan-to-income ratios, temporal patterns, financial stress indicators
- **Model Optimization** - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and threshold optimization
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Power BI visualization for risk analysis and portfolio monitoring  
- **Production Deployment** - Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
- **Complete Pipeline** - From raw data to deployable model with preprocessing

## Technical Highlights

- **Best Model**: LightGBM with 0.68 ROC-AUC score
- **Optimal Threshold**: 0.4 for balanced precision-recall trade-off
- **Key Risk Factors**: Loan-to-income ratio, customer age, interest fees
- **Data Handling**: SMOTE for class imbalance, robust preprocessing pipeline
